[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/barbu110/microloop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/barbu110/microloop)

Microloop is a minimalistic event-loop written in C++17 that aims to support
a Linux runtime.

## Building the sources

`microloop` uses the CMake build system so the procedure is pretty 
straightforward:

```bash
$ mkdir build; cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
